# Naming Kafka Topics

## Naming Conventions

- The only enforced rules for topic names are that they must be less than 256 characters, consist only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), “.”, “\_”, or “-”.
- There is no idiomatic or universally correct naming convention.
- Naming conventions can help reduce confusion, save time, and even increase reusability.
- Example of a naming convention:
  - Consider starting with a namespace, like `com.udacity`
  - Consider segmenting on schema or model type, like `com.udacity.lesson`, where `lesson` is the model
  - Consider segmenting on event type, like `com.udacity.lesson.quiz_complete`, where `quiz_complete` is the event
