# Introduction to Faust

Faust is built using modern Python features such as [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). Faust is embeddable as a library in existing applications. It can also be configured to be deployed as a stand-alone application in your infrastructure. Faust implements storage, time windowing, streams, tables, and many of the aggregate functions discussed in Lesson 5. It is important to note that Faust requires Python 3.6+ and **does not support Avro or Schema Registry** natively at this time.

## Robinhood Faust - Key Points

- [Built at Robinhood to tackle stream processing problems natively in Python](https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/faust-stream-processing-for-python-a66d3a51212d?gi=25dc91767251)
- Faust takes its design inspiration from [Kafka Streams, a JVM-only framework](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/)
- Faust is built using [modern Python features like asyncio, and requires Python 3.6 or higher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- Faust’s API implements the storage, windowing, aggregation, and other concepts discussed in Lesson 5
- Faust is a native Python API, not a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for metaprogramming
- Requires no external dependency other than Kafka. Does not require a resource manager like Yarn or Mesos.
- Faust [does not natively support Avro or Schema Registry]
